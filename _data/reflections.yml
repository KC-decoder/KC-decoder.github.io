                      Dr Wen Dong’s Introduction to Machine Learning was an academic turning point for me as this was the course which exposed me to Machine Learning in an academic setting. I had started working on my Machine Learning skills during the pandemic, for something to do, and as a result of which I realized that my area of interest was Machine Learning in Communications. I took CSE-574 to solidify the practical skills that I had acquired with some strong mathematical foundations. Looking back, I can confidently assert that this course not only provided me with a robust grounding in the domain but also jumpstarted my passion for delving deeper into the realm of advanced compu- tational models. The course started with an introductory module, setting the stage for what was to be an exhilarating educational experience. While Pa- rameter Learning and Linear Discriminant Analysis offered an insightful dive into data processing and classification, the exploration of Support Vector Ma- chines elucidated the nuances of maximizing margin for optimal classification. Subsequent modules introduced me to the dynamic landscapes of Graphical Models and Dense Neural Networks, illustrating the power and adaptability of machine learning models in handling diverse data structures. The course’s focus on Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision unraveled the intrica- cies behind image processing techniques. From segmentation to video-related processing, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how machines interpret visual data.The cur- riculum’s integration of Recurrent Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing illuminated the capabilities of machines in under- standing and generating human languages. By studying diverse datasets and applications such as sentiment analysis and image-to-text conversions, I could see the seamless fusion of linguistics and computation.Towards the advanced stages of the course, Bayesian Neural Networks, Deep generative models, and Gaussian Processes exposed me to probabilistic approaches in machine learning. This holistic learning experience ensured that I emerged from the course not just with theoretical knowledge, but with a deep-seated understanding of the myriad applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios. 1 A pivotal aspect of

                      my learning journey in the course was the hands-on project experience, which amalgamated the extensive theoretical knowledge I had garnered. This project was particularly significant as it utilized a rich dataset from MIT’s esteemed Human Dynamics Lab. The core objective of the project was to create an opti- mization model for an IoT-enabled smart office using Reinforcement Learning. To achieve this, we developed a stochastic game model, adeptly capturing the nuances of worker interactions within the workplace environment.Each worker in the dataset was treated as an agent with the dual responsibility of explo- ration (information sharing) and exploitation (information gathering). These dual objectives posed unique challenges, necessitating the creation of a model that could adeptly balance both. The dataset, sourced from MIT’s Human Dynamics Lab, encom- passed performance, behavioral patterns, and interper- sonal interactions of 36 participating workers over a span of one month. This data was collated from a 60-worker data-server configuration center located in Chicago. The rich dataset provided insights into diverse parameters like task assignment times, closure times, identification of task closers, difficulty levels, and the number of follow- ups required for each task over the month.The crux of our experimental goal was to quantitatively assess the costs and returns as- sociated with workers assisting each other in accomplishing tasks. Through this project, I was able to gain in- valuable insights into the dynamics of workplace interactions and the potential of Reinforcement Learning in optimizing such en- vironments. My accomplishment in the course, as mirrored in my A grade, was a testament to my dedication and the course’s comprehensive structure. This foundational strength in machine learning instilled in me the confidence and cu- riosity to explore advanced concepts. It prompted me to enroll in a subsequent Deep Learning course, eager to delve deeper into the ocean of computational models. In retrospection, the Spring ’23 machine learning course was more than just an academic endeavor; it was a transformative experience that shaped my perspectives on computation, data, and the vast potentials they harbor. It so- lidified my foundational mathematical skills in machine learning and instilled a zeal to continually explore, learn, and innovate in this ever-evolving domain.
