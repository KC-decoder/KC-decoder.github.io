Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! I am Koushani Chakrabarty, a seasoned professional with over 6 years of combined experience in academia and industry. My journey has been an exciting blend of Software Development, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing.Currently I am in the nascent stages of pursuing my PhD on Biomedical Engineering from the University of Buffalo. I am advised by Dr Leslie Ying. 

My career has seen me dive into fascinating projects, from developing cutting-edge Machine Learning models for sentiment analysis and developing Reinforcement Learning algorithms for UAVs, optimizing workplace environments using IoT and Reinforcement Learning to signal reconstruction in Medical Imaging using various types of Imaging Data such as: MRI signals, EEG etc. I'm on a constant quest for knowledge and thrive on sharing insights with my peers, all the while fostering a world-class engineering culture.

Outside the tech realm, I'm also deeply passionate about Indian Classical singing, with over 27 years of experience in this art form. When I'm not exploring the limitless possibilities of technology, you'll find me harmonizing the traditional melodies of India.

Join me on this multifaceted journey as we delve into the ever-evolving landscape of technology, innovation, and Art.
